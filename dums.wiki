Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests in this project, make sure you have the following configurations set up:
Visual Studio Code Settings

    Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
    Press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on macOS) to open the command palette.
    Type "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings" and press Enter.
    In the workspace settings, ensure that the following settings are configured:

json

{
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.unittestArgs": [
        "-v",
        "-s",
        "./tests",
        "-p",
        "*test*.py"
    ],
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": false
}

The above settings enable the unit testing framework for Python's unittest module and specify the arguments to be used when running the tests. The -s flag specifies the directory where the test files are located (./tests in this case), and the -p flag filters the test files based on a pattern (*test*.py in this case).
Running the Unit Tests

Once the Visual Studio Code settings are configured, you can run the unit tests by performing the following steps:

    Open the command palette in Visual Studio Code by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on macOS).
    Type "Python: Discover Tests" and press Enter. This will discover the unit tests in the specified directory.
    Open the command palette again and type "Python: Run All Unit Tests" to execute all the discovered unit tests.
