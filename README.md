## A wacky take on the original dominoes game.


### How the game works:

- When the game is run it prompts a user to select how many players will be participating and what  the score limit should be.

- Cards are then generated, shuffled and distributed evenly and according to the amount of players.

- The round begins and the first player is prompted to select a card from their deck of cards and is able to place the card on either side of the game board if they have a valid card else they are unable to play.

- The first player to run out of cards is allocated a point incrementing the amount of wins the player has, if both values of the players last card is equal to that of the numbers at both ends of the board or if no-one is able to play, the total of the numbers on their remaining cards will be compared to the other players totals, whoever has the lowest total will have their points incremented by 2 and the player is deemed winner of the round.

- After a player wins a round, the game then restarts a new round with newly shuffled cards and the next player in the order is made the first player and is prompted to select a card to place on the board. 

- This continues until one player wins enough rounds equal to that of the score limit, the player is deemed winner of the game and the game ends.
